  abstract = {Global aquaculture production has grown very rapidly in recent decades. This is largely due to a number of innovations that has increased the control with the production process and competitiveness. These innovations come in a number of forms from radical new concepts to knowledge adaption from the terrestrial food production system. While there exist a number of studies investigating the impact of specific innovations, there are few studies that take a larger perspective on how innovations over time impacts an aquaculture industry or the innovation system that support these innovations. In this paper we review the innovation process in Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry from its infancy in 1970 until present. Of particular interest is the increasing complexity of the industry, and how most innovations are conducted by suppliers and not the aquaculture producers themselves. The insights are also of general interest in global aquaculture as salmon is among the species with the most advanced production technologies, but also a species where innovations are adapted to other species also in very different production systems.},
