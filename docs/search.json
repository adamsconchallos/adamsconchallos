    "text": "I’m a Ph.D. student and research assistant. My research focuses on marine and aquaculture economics, exploring the nexus between institutions and marine ecosystems. My work investigates the impact of property rights on marine industry dynamics, the role of transnational firms in environmental and local governance outcomes, and the effects of industry ownership on community well-being. This question is increasingly critical as reliance on ocean resources escalates.\nIn addition to my doctoral studies, I have taught microeconomics, economics, econometrics, and environmental economics at various academic levels across multiple universities. I have also served as a research assistant and team coordinator at the Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR), focusing on sustainable aquaculture strategies in Chile.\nYou will find my academic outputs on this website, including articles, monographs, and translations. Additionally, the site provides updates on my current research projects, information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be presenting, and insights into my scholarly journey. I invite you to explore the content.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe test if the establishment of salmon farms in remote coastal areas had a significant impact on poverty reduction in the period 1992–2002 in Los Lagos Region, Chile. We employ impact assessment techniques using as control group people residing in geographic areas where no salmon farms were established during the period studied. Poverty incidence is estimated using small-area models at the household level that combines socioeconomic surveys with census data. Our results show that poverty decreased considerably more in localities where salmon farms were installed than in localities without salmon farms. We identify the distances between localities and salmon farms where this impact was significant. Our findings contribute to the debate on the socioeconomic effects of aquaculture for capital-intensive, international market-oriented industries."
