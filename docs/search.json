    "section": "",
    "text": "Global aquaculture production has been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Associated with this growth, there has been a discussion with respect to the industry’s socioeconomic impact. In particular, the industry’s ability to make a positive difference in the communities where it is conducted is often questioned. This is a difficult topic to address due to limited data availability. However, it is a critical question concerning the aquaculture industry’s long-term viability. Some recent studies have addressed specific indicators such as poverty reduction in a given country. However, no studies review the impact of an aquaculture industry on a broad set of indicators over time. In this paper, we review the impact of the Chilean salmon industry on three broad socioeconomic indicators: employment, salary level and migration; as well as several narrower indicators. While data beyond production initially are scarce and mostly found in the gray literature, the information they provide connects well with newer data sets as they become available. Not unexpectedly, employment in the Chilean aquaculture industry increases with production. The industry pays relatively well, and it has a societal impact as opportunities created by the industry first reverse outward migration and then lead to inward migration. This is also associated with reduced poverty, a more even income distribution, a higher female labor participation ratio, and higher education levels. While the overall socioeconomic impacts of the industry are positive, they are also disrupted by severe environmental crises and show that the socioeconomic benefits are conditioned on environmental sustainability."

You can find all the corresponding figures references in the slides or in the final version of the paper.\n\nGlobal aquaculture context\n\nAquaculture is one of the fastest-growing food production sectors globally, driven by the rising demand for sustainable protein sources.\nOver the past decades, aquaculture has expanded rapidly, particularly in developing countries, which now account for over 90% of production [Garlock et al., 2020; Naylor et al., 2021].\nWith its lower environmental footprint compared to other protein sources, aquaculture offers advantages for food security and resource efficiency [Gephart et al., 2021].\n\n\n\nChilean context\n\nChile is the world’s second-largest producer of farmed salmon, supplying around 25% of global production.\nThe industry began in the 1970s through public-private partnerships.\nDespite environmental and economic challenges, the salmon industry remains a critical economic driver for Chile [FAO, 2023].\n\n\n\n\nChiloé Island and Chilean southern regions (Billi et al., 2022)"

    "text": "Abstract\nWe analyzed the impact that the advent of the salmon aquaculture industry had on income distribution in coastal communities. Specifically, we evaluated whether salmon farms generated significant changes on household income distribution in the remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region in Chile between 1992 and 2002. Salmon farms were expected to generate new labor and income opportunities for the local population. The impact on income distribution in the area should depend on which type of households were favored with this increased labor demand: low-income or high-income households. We tested this by applying impact evaluation techniques. Changes in income distribution were measured using Gini, Theil, and Mean Log Deviation (MLD) indices. We used information generated by small area estimation methods to measure individual household incomes. This latter was utilized to calculate the distribution indices at the locality level. We controlled for pre-existing differences and observable characteristics in the treatment group. Our results show that income inequality in areas with salmon farms fell significantly compared to areas without farms and this attenuated a general trend towards increasing inequality in the rural sector. These results are conditioned by the zone of influence of salmon farming, since the distance between the farm and the locality plays an important role in the impact on inequality. Finally, our results suggest that improvements in the position of households with medium incomes explain the reduction in income inequality."

Empirical income distributions for treated and control 2 locations at 9 km for years 1992 and 2002. \nPanel A shows that in 1992, income distributions in both treated and control areas were alike. By 2002, these distributions spread out more. Notably, the income in treated locations showed a stronger shift towards a bi-modal distribution, a trend not observed in the control group.\nIn Panel B, the comparison of income distribution changes from 1992 to 2002 for both treated and control groups is shown. While both groups experienced similar shifts, the treated group’s income distinctly tended towards a bi-modal distribution, a pattern not seen in the control group.\nTable 6. The share of income in 1992 and 2002 for control 2 and treatment samples at different distances at the bottom 40%, middle 50%, and top 10% incomes of the population.  Table 6 shows an increasing concentration of income in the top decile over time, a trend also seen in the entire rural population. This trend occurs in both control and treated groups. However, the increase in income disparity was less in areas with salmon farms compared to those without. This difference is particularly evident in the reduced income share of the middle 50% in the treated areas (clearly lower for treated population). Therefore, the introduction of salmon farms in remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region appeared to moderate the overall rise in income inequality between 1992 and 2002."

    "text": "¿Por qué empezar un blog en medio del doctorado? Son varias las razones que me empujan a hacerlo. En realidad, diría que principalmente son tres. Hace tiempo que tengo una necesidad de escribir, de expresarme. No tengo claro de dónde viene el querer expresarme a través de la escritura. Sin embargo, puedo decir que escribir me ayuda a organizar las ideas de forma lógica, a reflexionar. También me ayuda a prestar atención (en una reunión o clase, me sirve mucho escribir lo que mi interlocutor dice, sin importar si después puedo leer aquello).\nCreo que me va a ayudar a escribir mejor y más rápido. Acabo de leer un artículo del The Economist en el que listan una serie de libros que podrían ayudar a escribir mejor. Voy a leerlos y postear lo que voy entendiendo de aquello (aunque están en inglés, asumo que también aquellas reglas sirven al español). Mi idea es ser proficiente escribiendo en inglés y español. Al final de cuentas, mi advisor dice que escribir es uno de los mayores activos de un investigador.\nPor ahí leí que el escribir sobre cosas permite aprender en profundidad. No tengo la fuente, pero no tengo dudas de que esto es verdad (al menos para mí). Cuando escribo algo con la intención enseñar o dejar escrito los pasos que seguí en un determinado proceso, mi entendimiento de la cosa es mucho mayor. Algo tiene que pasar con las neuronas y la materia gris. Al final es como ese dicho: si quieres aprender algo, tienes que enseñarlo.\nCon todo, sé que quizás alguien podría decir que esto del blog es una carga innecesaria a una ya ajetreada agenda doctoral. Lo único que puedo responder a eso es: voy a tratar. No me voy a matar escribiendo todas las semanas extensos tratados sobre la patita trasera izquierda de la mosca.\nVoy a postear contenido diverso, en inglés y español. Desde opiniones y puntos de vista personales, resúmenes de artículos o libros que me parezcan interesantes a tutoriales de alguna cosa que haya descubierto en el mundo de R y Quarto."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe test if the establishment of salmon farms in remote coastal areas had a significant impact on poverty reduction in the period 1992–2002 in Los Lagos Region, Chile. We employ impact assessment techniques using as control group people residing in geographic areas where no salmon farms were established during the period studied. Poverty incidence is estimated using small-area models at the household level that combines socioeconomic surveys with census data. Our results show that poverty decreased considerably more in localities where salmon farms were installed than in localities without salmon farms. We identify the distances between localities and salmon farms where this impact was significant. Our findings contribute to the debate on the socioeconomic effects of aquaculture for capital-intensive, international market-oriented industries."

Control 1 consisted of rural localities without any salmon concessions before 2002, used to evaluate the impact of new farm installations. Control 2 involved localities with salmon concessions before and after 1992. This second control is established for the possibility that some localities of Control 1 are not good controls because some may have characteristics that do not permit the installation of salmon farms.\n\nWOAR: regressions without additional regresors\nWAR: regressions with additional regressors\nGEN: genetic matching\n\nFigure 4 & 5: Estimated average treatment on the treated at different distances for different models (WOAR, WAR, GEN).

    "text": "Aquaculture’s rapidly increasing contribution to global aquatic food supply is masked by rhetoric on sustainability and international trade. We examine the association of country-level aquaculture production and per capita consumption of aquatic food in 163 countries. We find a positive association between aquaculture production and aquatic food consumption at the national scale where a 1% increase in domestic aquaculture production is associated with a 0.9% increase per capita consumption. The results corroborate previous case studies showing consumption of aquatic food has increased among the poor as domestic aquaculture has expanded. The findings provide important insight to the role of aquaculture in global food security and highlight the significance of advancing aquaculture development in regions with high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity."

The right panel shows that countries with per capita aquaculture production below 0.09 metric tons per 1000 persons did not exhibit a clear trend in consumption during the same period, while those with production between 0.09 and 2.9 metric tons per 1000 persons saw a notable increase in per capita consumption, despite having lower overall consumption levels.\nFigure 4.
