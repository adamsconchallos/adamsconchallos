    "section": "",
    "text": "Global aquaculture production has been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Associated with this growth, there has been a discussion with respect to the industry’s socioeconomic impact. In particular, the industry’s ability to make a positive difference in the communities where it is conducted is often questioned. This is a difficult topic to address due to limited data availability. However, it is a critical question concerning the aquaculture industry’s long-term viability. Some recent studies have addressed specific indicators such as poverty reduction in a given country. However, no studies review the impact of an aquaculture industry on a broad set of indicators over time. In this paper, we review the impact of the Chilean salmon industry on three broad socioeconomic indicators: employment, salary level and migration; as well as several narrower indicators. While data beyond production initially are scarce and mostly found in the gray literature, the information they provide connects well with newer data sets as they become available. Not unexpectedly, employment in the Chilean aquaculture industry increases with production. The industry pays relatively well, and it has a societal impact as opportunities created by the industry first reverse outward migration and then lead to inward migration. This is also associated with reduced poverty, a more even income distribution, a higher female labor participation ratio, and higher education levels. While the overall socioeconomic impacts of the industry are positive, they are also disrupted by severe environmental crises and show that the socioeconomic benefits are conditioned on environmental sustainability."

You can find all the corresponding figures references in the slides or in the final version of the paper.\n\nGlobal aquaculture context\n\nAquaculture is one of the fastest-growing food production sectors globally, driven by the rising demand for sustainable protein sources.\nOver the past decades, aquaculture has expanded rapidly, particularly in developing countries, which now account for over 90% of production [Garlock et al., 2020; Naylor et al., 2021].\nWith its lower environmental footprint compared to other protein sources, aquaculture offers advantages for food security and resource efficiency [Gephart et al., 2021].\n\n\n\nChilean context\n\nChile is the world’s second-largest producer of farmed salmon, supplying around 25% of global production.\nThe industry began in the 1970s through public-private partnerships.\nDespite environmental and economic challenges, the salmon industry remains a critical economic driver for Chile [FAO, 2023].\n\n\n\n\nChiloé Island and Chilean southern regions (Billi et al., 2022)"

    "text": "Abstract\nWe analyzed the impact that the advent of the salmon aquaculture industry had on income distribution in coastal communities. Specifically, we evaluated whether salmon farms generated significant changes on household income distribution in the remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region in Chile between 1992 and 2002. Salmon farms were expected to generate new labor and income opportunities for the local population. The impact on income distribution in the area should depend on which type of households were favored with this increased labor demand: low-income or high-income households. We tested this by applying impact evaluation techniques. Changes in income distribution were measured using Gini, Theil, and Mean Log Deviation (MLD) indices. We used information generated by small area estimation methods to measure individual household incomes. This latter was utilized to calculate the distribution indices at the locality level. We controlled for pre-existing differences and observable characteristics in the treatment group. Our results show that income inequality in areas with salmon farms fell significantly compared to areas without farms and this attenuated a general trend towards increasing inequality in the rural sector. These results are conditioned by the zone of influence of salmon farming, since the distance between the farm and the locality plays an important role in the impact on inequality. Finally, our results suggest that improvements in the position of households with medium incomes explain the reduction in income inequality."

Empirical income distributions for treated and control 2 locations at 9 km for years 1992 and 2002. \nPanel A shows that in 1992, income distributions in both treated and control areas were alike. By 2002, these distributions spread out more. Notably, the income in treated locations showed a stronger shift towards a bi-modal distribution, a trend not observed in the control group.\nIn Panel B, the comparison of income distribution changes from 1992 to 2002 for both treated and control groups is shown. While both groups experienced similar shifts, the treated group’s income distinctly tended towards a bi-modal distribution, a pattern not seen in the control group.\nTable 6. The share of income in 1992 and 2002 for control 2 and treatment samples at different distances at the bottom 40%, middle 50%, and top 10% incomes of the population.  Table 6 shows an increasing concentration of income in the top decile over time, a trend also seen in the entire rural population. This trend occurs in both control and treated groups. However, the increase in income disparity was less in areas with salmon farms compared to those without. This difference is particularly evident in the reduced income share of the middle 50% in the treated areas (clearly lower for treated population). Therefore, the introduction of salmon farms in remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region appeared to moderate the overall rise in income inequality between 1992 and 2002."

    "text": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nGlobal food production has grown remarkably since the 1960s, not by expanding farmland, but through technological intensification of agricultural practices. Mechanization, synthetic inputs, and genetic selection have increased yields on land and in water. However, this success has come alongside a quiet trend: we are increasingly relying on a shrinking set of species to feed the world. In this post, I speculate that economic incentives and ease of domestication have gradually locked us into a path where diversity is traded for efficiency. This path-dependent process may constrain the resilience of future food systems in ways that are not yet fully visible.\nAllow me to explore opinion fiction. One might ask: What is opinion fiction, and does such a thing even exist? Opinion and fiction must be closely related, regardless of whether the opinion holds any truth. I would argue, though, that opinion fiction must be treated with far more caution than regular opinion. Yet I would also say that opinion fiction proves more honest than expert opinion.\nWhy? Because expert opinion is masked with a royal cape that makes the listener hear something stripped of means to refute it, i.e., that opinion arrives bearing something akin to truth through its claim to expertise. But no one asks where your expertise comes from."

    "section": "The fact",
    "text": "The fact\nSince 1961, the average global food supply has increased from about 2,200 to nearly 3,000 calories per person per day. These impressive numbers do not mean that all people on the planet have that amount of calories available; we all know that is not true at all! Even so, the trend is striking: while the global population has more than tripled over this period, the amount of food produced has grown even faster. This expansion is not simply a story of feeding more mouths; it’s a story of unprecedented gains in productivity. The natural question that follows is: how was this achieved?\nOf course, I won’t delve into the details of this agricultural revolution (that would require a book, not a blog post, and I’m not that well-versed in agricultural history). However, the short version is as follows: yields increased not because we farmed more land, but because we farmed it more intensively. New seed varieties, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation systems all played a role. Mechanization replaced manual labor in many regions, and farms grew larger and more specialized. In the U.S., for example, corn production has risen nearly twentyfold over the past century, yet the total land used for corn has remained roughly the same (Ritchie, Rosado, and Roser 2023). This means we learned to produce far more from the same soil. As shown in Figure 1, the gains in output vastly outpaced any increase in land use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Corn production in the U.S. rose nearly twentyfold over the past century, while land use remained relatively stable. Source: Ritchie, Rosado, and Roser (2023)\n\n\n\nThis transformation is also evident in the way agriculture is practiced. Figure 2 illustrates a century of mechanization, from hand harvesting and mule-powered threshers to modern combine fleets. Fewer people now harvest more food, more quickly, on more standardized fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mechanization transformed how we harvest crops, from manual labor and mule-powered threshers to fleets of modern combines. Source: Van Trump Report (2022). “What Was Harvest Like Before the Combine?”. https://www.vantrumpreport.com/2022/11/01/what-was-harvest-like-before-the-combine/\n\n\n\nThe water saw a similar story. Aquaculture, once a minor contributor to the global food supply, has become the fastest-growing food production sector. Since 1990, global aquaculture production of aquatic animals rose from around 13 million to over 80 million metric tons, driven by new feed technologies, breeding programs, and a shift toward intensive farming systems. A recent study found that a 1% increase in domestic aquaculture production is associated with a 0.9% increase in national per-capita aquatic food consumption (Garlock et al. 2022).\nThis transformation is visible in the infrastructure itself. Over the past five decades, fish cages have undergone significant expansion in terms of size, depth, and materials. Early wooden structures from the 1970s held modest volumes and operated nearshore. Today, large offshore cages made of engineered plastics exceed 50 meters in diameter and can hold hundreds of thousands of fish (see Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Expansion of cage size and materials in marine finfish aquaculture from the 1970s to today. Early wooden cages were shallow and nearshore; today’s plastic systems exceed 50 meters in diameter and are designed for offshore conditions. Source: Afewerki et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nOperationally, aquaculture has followed a similar path of mechanization and specialization. In the past, net handling, grading, and feeding required teams of workers operating in small boats. Today, many of these tasks are handled by specialized vessels and automated systems. The contrast in labor and equipment over time is illustrated starkly in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Changes in operational intensity in marine salmon farming over the last four decades. From manual labor and small boats to automated feeding and large wellboats. Source: Arnesen (2010) “Sustainable Farming of Salmon”, Marine Harvest ASA presentation to the European Parliament, 23 Feb 2010.\n\n\n\nLike industrial agriculture, modern aquaculture represents a form of controlled production that substitutes capital and infrastructure for space and ecological variability. It is another example of how efficiency gains have reshaped how we produce food, whether on land or at sea.\nPlease don’t rush to find the downsides of this successful story before you’ve fully considered its merits. Of course, there are many issues, and in this post, we will not discuss the food distribution problem, the exposure of small production systems to global and integrated markets, which means the price does not accurately reflect the fragility of those small ecosystems, etc. Instead, we will now turn to the fiction part of this post, and later, I will try to merge these two to create opinion fiction."

    "text": "Another fact\nYet as food production has intensified, our diets have become more uniform. In Crops and Man, Jack Harlan warned that modern agriculture was feeding more people with fewer species of crops. Writing in the 1970s, he noted that, of the thousands of plant species historically used for food, only a few dozen had become globally dominant (Stalker, Warburton, and Harlan 2021).\nDecades later, Khoury and colleagues demonstrate that between 1961 and 2009, the composition of national food supplies worldwide became significantly more similar. Their study found that the average number of major food crops in national diets rose (from 50 to 60 species per country), but at the same time, the global convergence around a core group of crops increased dramatically (Khoury et al. 2014). Wheat, rice, maize, sugar, and soybeans now form the backbone of most diets worldwide. For example, the share of calories from just these top crops increased in nearly every region, while many regionally distinct crops saw declines. In effect, we are all drawing our calories from the same shrinking global menu (even if that menu includes slightly more items per country than before)."

    "text": "The fiction opinion\nConsider that this successful story arises from our ability to domesticate species that are more prone to domestication. Of course, we can comment on every single sentence because the assumption invites us to do so, but I will refrain for the sake of the post’s length and the fact that the reader’s attention diminishes sharply. So, it’s not a stretch to imagine that domestication itself drives this pattern. We don’t attempt to farm apex predators, such as tuna, or massive marine mammals like whales. Instead, we domesticate species that are biologically manageable, socially acceptable, and economically viable, like salmon or trout. It’s also reasonable to assume that profitability has guided our focus, resulting in a reduction of the species we raise and eat compared to what earlier food systems once relied on. Maybe domestication and profitability are two sides of the same coin.\nThat set of species may still change over time, but the signals driving those changes are now economic more than ecological or cultural. Relative prices1 push producers to reallocate attention toward the most rewarding species. As economists love to say, we’re always choosing the “optimal” bundle. But maybe what’s optimal for production isn’t optimal for diversity… or resilience of our food systems.\n1 Relative prices refer to the price of one good compared to another. For example, if wheat becomes more expensive than corn, producers may shift toward corn production. What’s “optimal” changes as these relationships shift.Perhaps it’s this very combination, i.e., ease of domestication and economic profitability, that underpins the success of food production we celebrate. But there’s something grim hidden in that success. What if the pattern we’re seeing is not simply a deliberate choice, but rather the consequence of many small decisions accumulating over time, each one logical and profitable on its own, yet collectively locking us into a path that’s increasingly difficult to reverse?\nThis is what economists call path dependence: early choices shape future possibilities, narrowing our options as we go. By selecting species that were easiest to domesticate and produced the highest immediate returns, we created a highly efficient, but increasingly rigid system. Each productive step forward made it harder to diversify or to revert to older, more varied agricultural systems.\nUnlike a factory that can retool or machines that can be rebuilt, biological diversity, once lost, isn’t easily restored. Every incremental step toward fewer species and greater productivity tightens our reliance on a smaller genetic base. We’re living off the productivity “dividends,” but at the hidden cost of resilience and adaptability. Over time, the cumulative effect is an agricultural system locked into fewer species, fewer genetic options, and fewer alternatives if something goes wrong.\nWe didn’t consciously trade away future flexibility; rather, we became locked into this narrow path precisely because it seemed optimal at each step. And now the momentum of past success makes it harder, not easier, to diversify or shift course.\nIncreasing efficiency has clear metrics, immediate returns, and builds on existing infrastructure. Increasing diversity means starting from scratch with unfamiliar species, uncertain yields, and no established markets. The incentive structure makes the efficient path almost inevitable, even when we know it’s risky."

Voy a leerlos y postear lo que voy entendiendo de aquello (aunque están en inglés, asumo que también aquellas reglas sirven al español). Mi idea es ser proficiente escribiendo en inglés y español. Al final de cuentas, mi advisor dice que escribir es uno de los mayores activos de un investigador.\nPor ahí leí que el escribir sobre cosas permite aprender en profundidad. No tengo la fuente, pero no tengo dudas de que esto es verdad (al menos para mí). Cuando escribo algo con la intención enseñar o dejar escrito los pasos que seguí en un determinado proceso, mi entendimiento de la cosa es mucho mayor. Algo tiene que pasar con las neuronas y la materia gris. Al final es como ese dicho: si quieres aprender algo, tienes que enseñarlo.\nCon todo, sé que quizás alguien podría decir que esto del blog es una carga innecesaria a una ya ajetreada agenda doctoral. Lo único que puedo responder a eso es: voy a tratar. No me voy a matar escribiendo todas las semanas extensos tratados sobre la patita trasera izquierda de la mosca.\nVoy a postear contenido diverso, en inglés y español.

    "text": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nModern food production is impressively efficient but increasingly homogenous, narrowing our dependence to a few hyper-productive species. This post reframes genetic diversity as a non-renewable resource, invoking economic ideas like Hotelling’s rule and Nordhaus’s backstop technology to argue that biodiversity loss behaves like the depletion of a strategic asset. Historical cases like the banana, citrus, and wheat industries show how producers often abandon at-risk lineages rather than coordinate costly solutions, accelerating genetic erosion. I explore a hypothetical market where biodiversity accrues scarcity rents, suggesting that only when diversity is valued like capital (rather than heritage) can we avoid locking ourselves into fragile, uniform food systems.\nIn the first part of this post, I wrote about the efficiency of modern food production. We also noted its shadow: a creeping uniformity, a path dependence that locks us into a handful of hyper‑productive species. I have to recognize though, that this path dependence story wasn’t explained well enough; maybe I will work on this explanation in a later post.\nIt would be easy to take this observation (of path dependence and lock in situation) down a dark road. My professional de-formation as a resource economist often pushes me toward scarcity narratives. After writing the first part, I realized how quickly the story could become Malthusian, i.e., the grim prediction that population inevitably outstrips food supply. Yet that view discounts humanity’s remarkable ability to innovate precisely when scarcity bites. Scarcity is rarely the endpoint; more often, it is the trigger that unleashes entirely new ways of producing what we need (I realize after finishing the post, that reads even more pessimistic than the first one; perhaps the problem is a personality trait of the writer).\nThis capacity for reinvention is not merely theoretical, it is embedded in how resource use decisions unfold over time. Economists have formalized this through models like the Hotelling rule, which prescribes how exhaustible resources should ideally be consumed over time to balance present use with future scarcity, and Nordhaus’s backstop framework (Nordhaus, Houthakker, and Solow 1973), which describes how rising scarcity or costs can make alternative technologies viable.\nConsider salmon aquaculture. Sixty years ago, launching a large‑scale salmon farm would have made little sense. Wild salmon were plentiful and inexpensive; the market for farmed fish was relatively small. However, as wild stock prices declined and demand increased, the economics shifted. We crossed a switch point, and today, farmed salmon is a multi‑billion‑dollar industry.This dynamic is a textbook example of Nordhaus’s “back‑stop technology” concept: once a cheap, finite resource runs short and its price rises, a more expensive but inexhaustible substitute becomes viable.\nCould our food system operate in a similar manner more broadly? When scarcity squeezes a staple crop, making it costlier or riskier, will we simply “switch on” a new food source from the planet’s biological library? What if, when that day comes, the library shelves are already bare? Will we end up eating cockroach protein bars as in Bong Joon‑ho’s Snowpiercer movie, where the tail section of the train survives on cockroach protein bars?"

    "section": "Diversity as a non-renewable resource",
    "text": "Diversity as a non-renewable resource\nStalker, Warburton, and Harlan (2021) documented that during earlier periods, particularly among pre-agricultural societies, more than 1,400 wild food species were used in sub‑Saharan Africa alone. FAO food‑balance sheets show that &gt;50 % of global calories now come from just three crops, i.e., wheat, rice, and maize, and another four species supply most of the rest. Diversity has already collapsed by over an order of magnitude.\nFor the argument that follows, let us assume that on a human timescale, edible diversity is a non-renewable resource. Evolution may replenish this stock over geological epochs, but not, I believe, within the lifetime of our civilization. Losing a species (or even a genetic lineage within one) is therefore an irreversible depletion of a finite asset. Of course, one could imagine some alternatives, such as humans evolving to live on air, a single strand of wheat providing complete nutrition, or aliens arriving with a galactic seed vault. But if that does not happen, and without abandoning major staples like wheat or beef, we are already surrendering irreplaceable versions of them. The Cavendish banana1 monoculture (Ploetz 2015), the decline of traditional poultry breeds, and the narrowing genetic base of global cattle herds FAO (2019) all demonstrate how quietly (and permanently) our options can disappear.\n1 2 of the 50 subgroups of banana account for 64% of all production\nAgricultural diversity, then, behaves like a non-renewable strategic asset. So what? Why is this guy putting so much effort into treating edible diversity as a non-renewable resource? Well, I think we can apply the well-known Hotelling rule to explain, predict, or simply consider grim futures (which I like to do).\nWhat is the Hotelling rule? Put simply, when a resource cannot be replaced, every unit left in the ground (or gene bank) gains value over time (like money earning interest) because using it today leaves less for tomorrow. If markets felt that built‑in “scarcity interest,” society would draw down the stock more slowly and spread use across generations. The problem is that market forces will continue to deplete it because its Hotelling scarcity rent (the premium that should rise as an exhaustible resource declines) is largely invisible to individual producers. This cost is spread thinly across society and is only realized when systemic risk materializes.\nBy contrast, the private gains from specializing in a profitable monoculture are immediate, certain, and easily captured. When the scarcity rent remains external to farm-gate decisions, genetic erosion proceeds at a faster rate than the socially optimal path, leaving society with fewer options than economic efficiency would dictate.\nThis pattern of “abandon and replace” is well-documented in agricultural history and crop breeding research. The agronomic convenience of monocultures makes them the short-run winner (uniform sowing rates, a single input schedule, one machine fleet). Yet, this standardization also synchronizes risk, resulting in “boom and bust” cycles for many crops. A classic example is the Gros Michel banana, nearly wiped out by Panama Disease (Fusarium oxysporum Tropical Race 1) in the mid-20th century, and replaced by the Cavendish cultivar, which is now itself threatened by Tropical Race 4 (TR4) (Ploetz 2015). Similarly, when citrus greening (Huanglongbing) affected Florida’s citrus industry, producers essentially chose to abandon susceptible varieties rather than pay for costly landscape-level management whose benefits would benefit others (Singerman, Lence, and Useche 2017; Farnsworth et al. 2014). Wheat breeding also illustrates this dynamic: the emergence of the Ug99 strain of wheat stem rust has triggered ongoing breeding programs to repeatedly shift genetic resistance, exemplifying the recurring nature of genetic erosion and replacement (Singh et al. 2011). Each time an epidemic surfaces, the cheapest private response, i.e., abandoning the affected genetic lineage and shifting to a new, resistant variant, quietly erodes our global genetic reservoir."

In such a world, the act of conserving biodiversity would carry an immediate financial reward, and the irreversible loss of a lineage would be seen not just as an ecological tragedy but an economic misstep. Gene banks would function like strategic petroleum reserves. Futures markets could emerge for crop traits such as drought resistance or disease tolerance, allowing for hedging against biological risks. The rising price of a depleting genetic option would signal its growing strategic value, influencing farm-level decisions, public investment, and long-term planning. In this framework, conservation would no longer need to rely on sentiment, regulation, or philanthropy. It would be driven by the cold, rational calculus of intertemporal asset management, a revaluation of biodiversity as capital, not just heritage.\nBiodiversity plays the role of the option set of future back‑stops: each crop or genetic lineage we still possess is a latent technology whose fixed cost of adoption has already been paid by evolution and traditional knowledge. Squandering that option set now means the future switch point could arrive with no affordable substitute left—no shelf to switch to—making systemic failure the default rather than the worst‑case scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency doesn’t mean equity.\n\n\n\nEven if markets recognize biodiversity’s value, that doesn’t guarantee access. Scarcity rents might conserve diversity, but they could also concentrate it."

    "text": "If these scarcity rents were to exist and guide our choices, would we still end up eating cockroach protein bars?\nI think the answer is yes: Scarcity rents may make biodiversity legible to markets, but they won’t necessarily make it accessible to all (there is nothing in economic efficiency that takes into account distributional things). If prices reflect true scarcity and humans remain shortsighted, then prices for “good food” could become so high that the majority are priced out. The most diverse, nutritious, and culturally significant foods could become luxury goods, while the masses are left with whatever backstop technology remains.

    "text": "Abstract\nWe test if the establishment of salmon farms in remote coastal areas had a significant impact on poverty reduction in the period 1992–2002 in Los Lagos Region, Chile. We employ impact assessment techniques using as control group people residing in geographic areas where no salmon farms were established during the period studied. Poverty incidence is estimated using small-area models at the household level that combines socioeconomic surveys with census data. Our results show that poverty decreased considerably more in localities where salmon farms were installed than in localities without salmon farms. We identify the distances between localities and salmon farms where this impact was significant. Our findings contribute to the debate on the socioeconomic effects of aquaculture for capital-intensive, international market-oriented industries."
