My work examines institutions, firm behavior, and market structures in marine resource industries, focusing on aquaculture and fisheries. Key research questions include the effects of property rights on industry composition and water quality; the influence of transnational firms on environmental outcomes and local institutions; and the impact of industry ownership on local communities. Understanding how human institutions can sustain marine ecosystems becomes crucial as reliance on oceans for food and energy grows. Following Mujica’s words, “It is possible to tear out the indigence of the world and march towards stability… and man, the conquering animal, will continue with his anthropological inclination, but he will need to govern himself as a species, or he will succumb,” my research seeks to answer: What do we need not to succumb?\nI am a Ph.D. student who also works as a teacher and research assistant. My teaching experience includes courses in microeconomics at the master’s level and economics, econometrics, and environmental economics at the undergraduate level, delivered across various universities. As a research assistant at the Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR), I was a multidisciplinary team coordinator in creating a strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture in Chile’s regional governments, focusing on socioeconomic sustainability.\nYou will find my academic outputs on this website, including articles, monographs, and translations. Additionally, the site provides updates on my current research projects, information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be presenting, and insights into my scholarly journey. I invite you to explore the content.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
