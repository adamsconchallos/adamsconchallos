    "text": "Abstract\nWe test if the establishment of salmon farms in remote coastal areas had a significant impact on poverty reduction in the period 1992–2002 in Los Lagos Region, Chile. We employ impact assessment techniques using as control group people residing in geographic areas where no salmon farms were established during the period studied. Poverty incidence is estimated using small-area models at the household level that combines socioeconomic surveys with census data. Our results show that poverty decreased considerably more in localities where salmon farms were installed than in localities without salmon farms. We identify the distances between localities and salmon farms where this impact was significant. Our findings contribute to the debate on the socioeconomic effects of aquaculture for capital-intensive, international market-oriented industries."

Control 1 consisted of rural localities without any salmon concessions before 2002, used to evaluate the impact of new farm installations. Control 2 involved localities with salmon concessions before and after 1992. This second control is established for the possibility that some localities of Control 1 are not good controls because some may have characteristics that do not permit the installation of salmon farms.\n\nWOAR: regressions without additional regresors\nWAR: regressions with additional regressors\nGEN: genetic matching\n\nFigure 4 & 5: Estimated average treatment on the treated at different distances for different models (WOAR, WAR, GEN).

    "text": "I’m a Ph.D. student and research assistant. My research focuses on marine and aquaculture economics, exploring the nexus between institutions and marine ecosystems. My work investigates the impact of property rights on marine industry dynamics, the role of transnational firms in environmental and local governance outcomes, and the effects of industry ownership on community well-being. This question is increasingly critical as reliance on ocean resources escalates.\nIn addition to my doctoral studies, I have taught microeconomics, economics, econometrics, and environmental economics at various academic levels across multiple universities. I have also served as a research assistant and team coordinator at the Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR), focusing on sustainable aquaculture strategies in Chile.\nYou will find my academic outputs on this website, including articles, monographs, and translations. Additionally, the site provides updates on my current research projects, information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be presenting, and insights into my scholarly journey. I invite you to explore the content.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe analyzed the impact that the advent of the salmon aquaculture industry had on income distribution in coastal communities. Specifically, we evaluated whether salmon farms generated significant changes on household income distribution in the remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region in Chile between 1992 and 2002. Salmon farms were expected to generate new labor and income opportunities for the local population. The impact on income distribution in the area should depend on which type of households were favored with this increased labor demand: low-income or high-income households. We tested this by applying impact evaluation techniques. Changes in income distribution were measured using Gini, Theil, and Mean Log Deviation (MLD) indices. We used information generated by small area estimation methods to measure individual household incomes. This latter was utilized to calculate the distribution indices at the locality level. We controlled for pre-existing differences and observable characteristics in the treatment group. Our results show that income inequality in areas with salmon farms fell significantly compared to areas without farms and this attenuated a general trend towards increasing inequality in the rural sector. These results are conditioned by the zone of influence of salmon farming, since the distance between the farm and the locality plays an important role in the impact on inequality. Finally, our results suggest that improvements in the position of households with medium incomes explain the reduction in income inequality."

Empirical income distributions for treated and control 2 locations at 9 km for years 1992 and 2002. \nPanel A shows that in 1992, income distributions in both treated and control areas were alike. By 2002, these distributions spread out more. Notably, the income in treated locations showed a stronger shift towards a bi-modal distribution, a trend not observed in the control group.\nIn Panel B, the comparison of income distribution changes from 1992 to 2002 for both treated and control groups is shown. While both groups experienced similar shifts, the treated group’s income distinctly tended towards a bi-modal distribution, a pattern not seen in the control group.\nTable 6. The share of income in 1992 and 2002 for control 2 and treatment samples at different distances at the bottom 40%, middle 50%, and top 10% incomes of the population.  Table 6 shows an increasing concentration of income in the top decile over time, a trend also seen in the entire rural population. This trend occurs in both control and treated groups. However, the increase in income disparity was less in areas with salmon farms compared to those without. This difference is particularly evident in the reduced income share of the middle 50% in the treated areas (clearly lower for treated population). Therefore, the introduction of salmon farms in remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region appeared to moderate the overall rise in income inequality between 1992 and 2002."

We find a positive association between aquaculture production and aquatic food consumption at the national scale where a 1% increase in domestic aquaculture production is associated with a 0.9% increase per capita consumption. The results corroborate previous case studies showing consumption of aquatic food has increased among the poor as domestic aquaculture has expanded. The findings provide important insight to the role of aquaculture in global food security and highlight the significance of advancing aquaculture development in regions with high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity."
