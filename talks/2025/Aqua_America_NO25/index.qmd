* Concentrated ownership improves management

::: info-box

- Higher ownership concentration (measured via the Biomass Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (BHHI)) significantly reduces sea lice severity on farms already experiencing infestations, suggesting that coordinated management strategies enhance treatment efficacy.
- 100‐point increase in the BHHI is associated with approximately a 15–16% reduction in sea lice levels on farms already experiencing infestations.

* Limited impact on infestation occurrence




::: info-box

The study finds no evidence that increased ownership concentration affects the initial probability of a sea lice outbreak, suggesting that preventive measures may require different strategies.

1. Each farm makes independent decisions, often prioritizing private costs over collective disease control.
2. Disease spreads within each area, but without coordination, some farms underinvest in treatment, leading to persistent infections.
3. Spillovers between areas create externalities, but ownership concentration internalizes these effects, ensuring synchronized management, reducing free-riding, and improving disease control efficiency.

- Norway's coast is divided into <span class="fragment highlight-red" fragment-index=2>13 production zones (PZs)</span>.
- PZs are designed to <span class="fragment highlight-red" fragment-index=3>minimize cross-zone contamination</span> of salmon lice and other parasites [@Adlandsvik2015].
- Farmers require licenses and allocated sites to operate
- Licensing criteria have shifted with government priorities, leading to inconsistent regulations, unclear criteria, and legal disputes [@anon_recommendation_2015; @hersoug_great_2019].

## The BHHI

The **BHHI** quantifies ownership concentration in a production zone. It is calculated in two steps:

1. **Biomass Share Calculation:** For each firm *i* in production zone *p* at time *t*:  $s_{itp} = \frac{q_{itp}}{\sum_{i=1}^n q_{itp}}$ where $q_{itp}$ is the biomass (in kg).
2. **BHHI Calculation:**  
   Sum of squared biomass shares:  
   $$\text{BHHI}_{pt} = \sum_{i=1}^n s_{itp}^2$$

## Overview of the dataset

- **Time Period & Scope:**  
  - Covers 2012–2017 with 30,566 monthly reports.
  - Data from 849 salmon production sites, representing approximately 90% of total production.

---

# Estimation procedure overview

Our study evaluates how ownership concentration affects sea lice management using two models:

:::{.callout-note }
## Extensive margin
  - We estimate the probability that a farm experiences any sea lice infestation.
  - A fixed-effects probit model with a control function is used to adjust for endogeneity.

:::

:::{.callout-note}
## Intensive margin
  - For farms with sea lice present, we assess the severity of infestation.
  - A two-stage least squares (2SLS) method is employed using an instrument (based on production cycles in other zones) to address potential endogeneity.
