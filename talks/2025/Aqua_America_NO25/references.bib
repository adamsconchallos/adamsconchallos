We decompose the impact of sending an international migrant into an effect attributable to a change in the gender of the household head and other mechanisms. We find that the effect attributable to a shift from a male-to-a female household head due to migration is negative for economic activities and expenditure indicators. Our results suggest that some households are forced to weigh the benefits of sending an international migrant against the costs of switching to a female household head.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to convey to a wider audience of applied statisticians that nonparametric (matching) estimation methods can be a very convenient tool to overcome problems with endogenous control variables. In empirical research one is often interested in the causal effect of a variable X on some outcome variable Y. With observational data, i.e. in the absence of random assignment, the correlation between X and Y generally does not reflect the treatment effect but is confounded by differences in observed and unobserved characteristics. Econometricians often use two different approaches to overcome this problem of confounding by other characteristics. First, controlling for observed characteristics, often referred to as selection on observables, or instrumental variables regression, usually with additional control variables. Instrumental variables estimation is probably the most important estimator in applied work. In many applications, these control variables are themselves correlated with the error term, making ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares inconsistent. The usual solution is to search for additional instrumental variables for these endogenous control variables, which is often difficult. We argue that nonparametric methods help to reduce the number of instruments needed. In fact, we need only one instrument whereas with conventional approaches one may need two, three or even more instruments for consistency. Nonparametric matching estimators permit consistent estimation without the need for (additional) instrumental variables and permit arbitrary functional forms and treatment effect heterogeneity.},

In Norway, this externality is managed using a traffic light system (TLS), and the purpose of this system is to regulate the estimated aggregated salmon lice-induced mortality of wild salmon stocks in a number of production areas. This paper evaluates the TLS and in doing so, we depart from the literature on the regulation of nonpoint pollution problems. We argue that limited perceived influence of individual actions on the mortality of wild salmon stocks, difficulties in obtaining a reliable measure for the aggregated salmon lice-induced mortality and collective punishment of individual actions constitute the major problems of the TLS. As alternatives to the TLS, we discuss a subsidy to reduce the amount of salmon lice and a tax on salmon lice at farm site level.},

The industry has a global reach with Norwegian seafood reaching 172 different countries in the period 2016–2020. While there are as many as 437 different exporting firms, this is relatively few firms compared to the 11,024 different buyers that import Norwegian seafood. There is significant heterogeneity in the export sector from very small firms handling only a few products to very large firms handling a large variety of products. The average firm is quite specialized and serves only 9 markets. However, there are also a handful of large exporters who ship products from all three main sectors in the Norwegian seafood industry to a large number of markets. The 10\% largest companies make up 39\% of the total export value and provide significant synergies between the aquaculture, pelagic and whitefish sectors.},

For probit index coefficients, the former term is proportional to the true value of the coefficients being estimated. This result allows me to derive a lower bound for the bias of the MLE. I then show that the resulting fixed effects estimates of ratios of coefficients and average marginal effects exhibit no bias in the absence of heterogeneity and negligible bias for a wide variety of distributions of regressors and individual effects in the presence of heterogeneity. I subsequently propose new bias-corrected estimators of index coefficients and marginal effects with improved finite sample properties for linear and nonlinear models with predetermined regressors.},

In this paper, we investigate the degree of concentration in each of the main producer countries for Atlantic salmon, as well as globally for Atlantic salmon, all farmed salmon, and all salmon to account for the global nature of the market using Herfindahl-Hirschman Indexes. The results indicate a high degree of concentration in the smaller producer nations but not in Chile and Norway. Globally, the Atlantic salmon industry can be characterized as unconcentrated, and it becomes even more so when the supply of other farmed salmon and wild salmon is accounted for. Hence, the main motivation for the increased company size appears to be capacity to adopt new knowledge and technology.},

	abstract = {"Within fisheries and natural resource management literature, there is considerable discussion about the key roles that property rights can play in building biologically and socially sustainable resource management regimes. A key point of agreement is that secure long-term property rights provide an incentive for resource users to manage the resource sustainably. However, property rights mismatches create ambiguity and conflict in resource use. Though the term mismatches is usually associated with problems in matching temporal and spatial resource characteristics with institutional characteristics, I expand it here to include problems that can arise when property rights are incompletely defined or incompletely distributed. Property rights mismatches are particularly likely to occur over marine resources, for which multiple types of resource and resource user can be engaged and managed under a variety of regulatory regimes. I used New Zealand's marine resources to examine the causes and consequences of these property rights mismatches. New Zealand is particularly interesting because its property-rights-based commercial fishing regime, in the form of individual transferable quotas, has attracted considerable positive attention. However, my review of the marine natural resource management regime from a broader property rights perspective highlights a series of problems caused by property rights mismatches, including competition for resources among commercial, customary, and recreational fishers; spatial conflict among many marine resource users; and conflicting incentives and objectives for the management of resources over time. The use of a property rights perspective also highlights some potential solutions such as the layering of institutional arrangements and the improvement of how property rights are defined to encourage long-term sustainability."},

Scientists recommend controlling the vector of the disease, and area-wide pest management has been proposed as a superior alternative to individual pest management. We analyzed a unique dataset of farm-level citrus yields that allowed us to test this hypothesis. We found that yields of blocks located in an area with higher participation in coordinated sprays were 28\%, 73\%, and 98\% higher in 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15, respectively, compared to the yields of blocks under the same management but located in an area with lower participation. These results provide evidence on the efficiency of a well-performing pest management area to deal with citrus greening. However, participation in Citrus Health Management Areas has not been commensurate with this evidence. We present survey data that provide insights about producers’ preferences and attitudes toward the area-wide pest management program. Despite the economic benefit we found area-wide pest management can provide, the strategic uncertainty involved in relying on neighbors seems to impose too high of a cost for most growers, who end up not coordinating sprays.},

	abstract = {When studying an outcome Y that is weakly positive but can equal zero (e.g., earnings), researchers frequently estimate an average treatment effect (ATE) for a “log-like” transformation that behaves like log (Y) for large Y but is defined at zero (e.g., log (1 + Y), \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{arcsinh\}(Y)\$). We argue that ATEs for log-like transformations should not be interpreted as approximating percentage effects, since unlike a percentage, they depend on the units of the outcome. In fact, we show that if the treatment affects the extensive margin, one can obtain a treatment effect of any magnitude simply by rescaling the units of Y before taking the log-like transformation. This arbitrary unit dependence arises because an individual-level percentage effect is not well-defined for individuals whose outcome changes from zero to nonzero when receiving treatment, and the units of the outcome implicitly determine how much weight the ATE for a log-like transformation places on the extensive margin. We further establish a trilemma: when the outcome can equal zero, there is no treatment effect parameter that is an average of individual-level treatment effects, unit invariant, and point identified. We discuss several alternative approaches that may be sensible in settings with an intensive and extensive margin, including (i) expressing the ATE in levels as a percentage (e.g., using Poisson regression), (ii) explicitly calibrating the value placed on the intensive and extensive margins, and (iii) estimating separate effects for the two margins (e.g., using Lee bounds). We illustrate these approaches in three empirical applications.},

To manage private risks and reduce externalities, biological controls leverage the technology of natural ecosystems and are often considered environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical controls. In salmon farming, parasitic sea lice reduce own-firm profitability by stressing fish and slowing growth and generate externalities by spreading to neighboring farms and threatening wild fish populations. Cleaner fish are a form of biological control based on ecological interaction that can be used instead of chemical control of sea lice, but little is known about their efficacy and value in commercial use. We estimate efficacy of cleaner fish using facility-level data. To identify exogenous variation in cleaner fish usage, we instrument site-level cleaner fish stocks using distance to cleaner fish farm with a commercial license. Cleaner fish use significantly reduces likelihood of sea lice levels exceeding regulatory threshold levels. Combining efficacy estimates with cost data and a structural model, we provide estimates of costeffectiveness. Our results show that cleaner fish are privately cost-effective, which is consistent with high levels of adoption. However, cost-effectiveness also suggests that policy could encourage even more adoption of biological controls to reduce externalities.},

	abstract = {Salmon farming increases the abundance of salmon lice, which are ectoparasites of salmonids in the sea. Here we review the current knowledge on the effects of salmon lice on wild sea trout. Salmon lice feed on host mucus, skin and muscle, and infestation may induce osmoregulatory dysfunction, physiological stress, anaemia, reduced feeding and growth, increased susceptibility to secondary infections, reduced disease resistance and ultimately mortality of individual sea trout. Wild sea trout in farm-free areas generally show low lice levels. In farm-intensive areas, lice levels on wild sea trout are typically higher, and more variable than in farm-free areas. Lice on wild sea trout are found at elevated levels particularly within 30 km of the nearest farms but can also extend to further ranges. Salmon lice in intensively farmed areas have negatively impacted wild sea trout populations by reducing growth and increasing marine mortality. Quantification of these impacts remains a challenge, although population-level effects have been quantified in Atlantic salmon by comparing the survival of chemically protected fish with control groups, which are relevant also for sea trout. Mortality attributable to salmon lice can lead to an average of 12−29\% fewer salmon spawners. Reduced growth and increased mortality will reduce the benefits of marine migration for sea trout, and may also result in selection against anadromy in areas with high lice levels. Salmon lice-induced effects on sea trout populations may also extend to altered genetic composition and reduced diversity, and possibly to the local loss of sea trout, and establishment of exclusively freshwater resident populations.},

Using a farm-level data set containing sea lice infestation counts for all Norwegian salmon farms over an 84-month period, we empirically investigate the biological and economic impacts of observed levels of infective lice. Sea lice, a common ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids, have been shown to reduce fish growth and appetite and cause substantial costs to salmon farmers worldwide. Our results suggest that the percent of total biomass growth lost per production cycle due to average infestations varies from 3.62 to 16.55\%, despite control, and depends on farm location. Using a discrete harvesting model, we simulate the economic impact on farm profits over typical cycles. An average infestation over a typical central region spring-release cycle generates damages of US\$0.46 per kg of harvested biomass, equivalent to 9\% of farm revenues. We estimate that lice parasitism produced US\$436m in damages to the Norwegian industry in 2011.},

Samples were taken downstream inside and immediately outside of cages, at one locality with lice skirts and two localities without lice skirts. There were no differences in densities of planktonic sea lice in samples taken from the inside or the outside of cages for any of the localities. However, the proportion-non-zero of planktonic sea lice samples taken from inside the cage was higher during months with a temperature above 9°C (mean abundance: 0.40–2.5 individuals m–3) than months with temperature below 9°C (mean abundance: 0.02–0.21 individuals m–3, odds ratio of the proportion-non-zero: p {\textless} 0.01). Densities of planktonic sea lice correlated most strongly with temperature in the first year (τ = 0.44–0.57, p {\textless} 0.05). A significant correlation between the number of adult female lice on salmon and average density of plankton sea lice was found in the locality with lice skirts during the second year (τ = 0.43 inside cages, τ = 0.58 outside cages, both p values {\textless} 0.05). Background levels of planktonic sea lice in the succeeding fallowing period showed neither L. salmonis nor C. elongatus planktonic sea lice, suggesting that there was successful reduction of the densities of planktonic sea lice for this area during the fallowing period.},

This paper reviews the developments in global aquaculture from 1997 to 2017, incorporating all industry sub-sectors and highlighting the integration of aquaculture in the global food system. Inland aquaculture—especially in Asia—has contributed the most to global production volumes and food security. Major gains have also occurred in aquaculture feed efficiency and fish nutrition, lowering the fish-in–fish-out ratio for all fed species, although the dependence on marine ingredients persists and reliance on terrestrial ingredients has increased. The culture of both molluscs and seaweed is increasingly recognized for its ecosystem services; however, the quantification, valuation, and market development of these services remain rare. The potential for molluscs and seaweed to support global nutritional security is underexploited. Management of pathogens, parasites, and pests remains a sustainability challenge industry-wide, and the effects of climate change on aquaculture remain uncertain and difficult to validate. Pressure on the aquaculture industry to embrace comprehensive sustainability measures during this 20-year period have improved the governance, technology, siting, and management in many cases.},

We also find that the optimal harvest rule may include closure of some areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent basis (biological reserves). Reserves alone cannot correct open access, but may, under sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity, increase profits if appropriate harvest controls are in place outside of reserves.},

	abstract = {We survey the weak instrumental variables (IV) literature with the aim of giving simple advice to applied researchers. This literature focuses heavily on the problem of size inflation in two-stage least squares (2SLS) two-tailed t-tests that arises if instruments are weak. A common standard for acceptable instrument strength is a first-stage F of 10, which renders this size inflation modest. However, 2SLS suffers from other important problems that exist at much higher levels of instrument strength. In particular, 2SLS standard errors tend to be artificially small in samples where the 2SLS estimate is close to ordinary least squares (OLS). This power asymmetry means the t-test has inflated power to detect false positive effects when the OLS bias is positive. The Anderson-Rubin (AR) test avoids this problem and should be used in lieu of the t-test even with strong instruments. We illustrate the practical importance of this issue in IV papers published in the American Economic Review from 2011 to 2023. Use of the AR test often reverses t-test results. In particular, IV estimates that are close to OLS and significant according to the t-test are often insignificant according to AR. We also show that for first-stage F in the 10–20 range there is a high probability that OLS estimates will be closer to the truth than 2SLS. Hence we advocate a higher standard of instrument strength in applied work.},

First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their instruments due to non-i.i.d. error structures such as clustering. Second, IV estimates are often highly uncertain, and the commonly used t-test for two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates frequently underestimate the uncertainties. Third, in most replicated studies, 2SLS estimates are significantly larger in magnitude than ordinary-least-squares estimates, and their absolute ratio is inversely related to the strength of the instrument in observational studies—a pattern not observed in experimental ones—suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness or the exclusion restriction in the former.

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

We illustrate the approaches with empirical examples that examine the effect of 401(k) participation on asset accumulation, price elasticity of demand for margarine, and returns to schooling. We find that inference is informative even with a substantial relaxation of the exclusion restriction in two of the three cases.},

	abstract = {Since the beginnings of the aquaculture industry in Norway, the salmon farming industry has grown from a pioneering niche to a massive industrial adventure. Since 1992, Norwegian salmon production has increased to ten times its 1992 level. By 2015, the Norwegian production constituted 53\% of the world's production of Atlantic salmon. Therefore, it could be said that salmon farming is the most important industry in rural Norway today, with a yearly landing value of about 6.1 billion EUR. As the production has grown, along with the income, numerous environmental issues have arisen. The present paper gives an overview of these environmental problems and discusses potential solutions, as well as the need for a better and more holistic regulation of the industry. The experience from Norwegian salmon farming with respect to environmental issues and regulation may give important insights to both other salmon producing countries as well as producers of other fish species.},

Samples were taken downstream inside and immediately outside of cages, at one locality with lice skirts and two localities without lice skirts. There were no differences in densities of planktonic sea lice in samples taken from the inside or the outside of cages for any of the localities. However, the proportion-non-zero of planktonic sea lice samples taken from inside the cage was higher during months with a temperature above 9°C (mean abundance: 0.40–2.5 individuals m–3) than months with temperature below 9°C (mean abundance: 0.02–0.21 individuals m–3, odds ratio of the proportion-non-zero: p {\textless} 0.01). Densities of planktonic sea lice correlated most strongly with temperature in the first year (τ = 0.44–0.57, p {\textless} 0.05). A significant correlation between the number of adult female lice on salmon and average density of plankton sea lice was found in the locality with lice skirts during the second year (τ = 0.43 inside cages, τ = 0.58 outside cages, both p values {\textless} 0.05). Background levels of planktonic sea lice in the succeeding fallowing period showed neither L. salmonis nor C. elongatus planktonic sea lice, suggesting that there was successful reduction of the densities of planktonic sea lice for this area during the fallowing period.},

Using statistical analysis of per capita growth rate estimates, we found that areawide suppression of the primary pest Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer) is associated with Bt maize use. Cumulative benefits over 14 years are an estimated \$3.2 billion for maize growers in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, with more than \$2.4 billion of this total accruing to non-Bt maize growers. Comparable estimates for Iowa and Nebraska are \$3.6 billion in total, with \$1.9 billion for non-Bt maize growers. These results affirm theoretical predictions of pest population suppression and highlight economic incentives for growers to maintain non-Bt maize refugia for sustainable insect resistance management.},

The increase in the number of primary introductions and the scientific data available on the molecular basis of pathogenicity have generated concerns particularly for legislative purposes and for international trade. This has led to a new proposed definition of 'avian influenza' to extend all infections caused by H5 and H7 viruses regardless of their virulence as notifiable diseases, although this has encountered some difficulties in being approved. The paper also reviews the major outbreaks caused by viruses of the H5 or H7 subtype and the control measures applied. The zoonotic aspects of avian influenza, which until 1997 were considered to be of limited relevance in human medicine, are also discussed. The human health implications have now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities that have occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and for the potential of generating a reassortant virus that could give rise to the next human influenza pandemic.},

One class of estimators requires only specification of the conditional mean; in particular, the multinomial quasi-conditional maximum likelihood estimator is shown to be consistent when only the conditional mean in the unobserved effects model is correctly specified. Additional orthogonality conditions can be used in a method of moments framework. A second class of problems specifies the conditional mean, conditional variances, and conditional covariances. Using the notion of a conditional linear predictor, it is shown that specification of conditional second moments implies further orthogonality conditions in the observable data that can be exploited for efficiency gains. This has applications to both count and gamma-type panel data regression models.},

Since publication of the first edition of this book, the salmon aquaculture industry has grown at a phenomenal rate, with salmon now being consumed in more than 100 countries worldwide. This second edition of a very popular and successful book brings the reader right up to date with all the major current issues pertaining to salmon aquaculture. Commencing with an overview of the production process in aquaculture, the following chapters provide in-depth coverage of the sources of the world’s supply of salmon, the growth in productivity, technological changes, environmental issues, markets, market structure and competitiveness, lessons that can be learnt from the culture of other species, optimal harvesting techniques, production planning, and investment in salmon farms. Written by Frank Ashe and Trond Bjørndal, two of the world's leading experts in the economics of aquaculture, this second edition of The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture provides the salmon aquaculture industry with an essential reference work, including a wealth of commercially important information. This book is also a valuable resource for upper level students and professionals in aquaculture and economics, and libraries in all universities and research establishments where these subjects are studied and taught should have copies of this important book on their shelves.},

Severe drought and wind erosion hit the Great Plains in 1930 and lasted through 1940. There were similar droughts in the 1950s and 1970s, but no comparable level of wind erosion. We explain why. The prevalence of small farms in the 1930s limited private solutions for controlling the downwind externalities associated with wind erosion. Drifting sand from unprotected fields damaged neighboring farms. Small farmers cultivated more of their land and were less likely to invest in erosion control than larger farmers. Soil conservation districts, established by the government after 1937, helped coordinate erosion control. This “unitized” solution for collective action is similar to that used in other natural resource/environmental settings.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is considered a high-risk industry in which the heterogeneity of the productions hinders the development and application of risk management. However, risk sources have still received little attention in aquaculture research. The present study aims to provide a framework of the main risk sources perceived by aquaculture producers. Firstly, we conceptualize the different dimensions and typologies of risks. Then, we integrate the main risk sources into a comprehensive framework based on a review of the literature providing empirical evidence on aquaculture producers’ risk perceptions in different countries and aquaculture productions. Finally, the opinion of a panel of independent experts provides the vision of other relevant stakeholders in the value chain. This process allowed us to present a picture of risks in the aquaculture industry, consisting of eight risk categories, 19 risk types and 40 risk sources. The most relevant sources of risks for producers in the internal dimension are those related to operations (fingerlings, feeding, seeding and harvesting). In the external dimension, market risks (price variability, inputs price, and changes in demand) and production risks (climatic shocks and diseases) stand out. The perceptions of the stakeholders consulted highlight that producers tend to underestimate important risks, such as regulatory or financial ones. This picture provides a useful risk framework for policy makers, producers, scientists and other stakeholders to address such an essential first step in risk management and governance, the identification of risk sources. © 2022 The Authors},

In this study, we aimed to describe the various cultural and operational characteristics of smallholder and commercial shrimp (P. vannamei) farms in the Davao region. We also evaluated the current risks and challenges faced by the shrimp farmers. A semi-structured questionnaire that focused on shrimp farmers and operators in the region was used to collect data from N = 41 farmers and operators. The results showed that respondents who were engaged in smallholder farming activities had an average yield of 10 tons/ha. The commercial farms that operate intensively had an average yield of 24 tons/ha. Most smallholder operators used electric generator machines to conduct aeration in their farms using paddlewheels and blowers. More paddlewheels and blowers were employed per pond in the commercial farms compared to smallholder farms. Generally, the income of a farm was related to their yield or the number of fries rather than social factors or their size. In terms of input costs, feeds were found to have the highest cost, followed by the fry, fuel, labor, and others (fertilizers and water treatment chemicals). Most of the farmers mentioned that their shrimp are affected by diseases such as white spot syndrome (60\%), black gills (35\%), and red tail (5\%). They perceived that the main contamination comes from the water source (31\%). The main threats mentioned were declining shrimp prices in the market, source of fry, water disposal, overstocking, and water quality. This study shows that small-holding fish farmers should be supported by the government so that they can make use of the more advanced technology employed by commercial shrimp farmers in order to increase their economic productivity and lower their environmental footprint. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Aquaculture production is an important part of the global food supply and has equaled or surpassed fisheries production as the main source of aquatic foods. Aquaculture is a resource intensive practice that can use large amounts of land, water, energy, and cause pollution and degradation to the local environment. Intensive production practices have been criticized in the past for causing environmental harm; however recent studies have suggested that resource use may decrease with increasing production intensities at the farm level. Here we used a conceptual farm to access the impact of a few key production parameters on land, water, and energy use. A series of calculations were conducted at various production intensities with modifications made to the type of feed used and water exchange rate. The resulting relationships were then modeled with production intensity. Additionally, the effect of various feedstuffs on embodied resource coefficients was examined through varying protein and carbohydrate feedstuffs. Land and water use were found to have an asymptotic relationship with production intensity, with the most important factor in land use being production intensity and the most important factor in water use being the water exchange rate. Energy use was found to be higher with a diet that has fish meal as a protein source and at higher water exchange rates. The most land intensive diets used for shrimp contained high fish meal with rice as carbohydrate feedstuffs (0.550 ha/tonne). The most water intensive diet was no fish meal with corn as a carbohydrate (1863 m3/tonne), and the most energy intensive diet was high fish meal with corn as a carbohydrate (11.73 GJ/tonne). The results herein suggest that intensifying shrimp aquaculture could save resources based on per tonne of production basis.},

	abstract = {The shrimp sector has been one of the fastest growing agri-food systems in the last decades, but its growth has entailed negative social and environmental impacts. Sustainable intensification will require innovation in multiple elements of the shrimp production system and its value chain. We use the case of the shrimp sector in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to explore the constraints in the transition to sustainable intensification in shrimp farming, using an analytical framework based on innovation systems thinking, i.e., an aquaculture innovation systems framework. Using this framework, we conduct a systemic diagnostic of blocking mechanisms, interrelated sets of constraints within the aquaculture sector that hinder a transition toward sustainable intensification. Our findings show that the major constraints are institutional, with limited enforcement of the regulatory framework for input quality control, disease control, and wastewater management, and a lack of coordination between government bodies to design and enforce this framework. At farm level, limited access to capital favors pond mismanagement and the use of low-quality inputs. The absence of multi-stakeholder initiatives to foster dialog between actors in the value chain constrains the response to new regulations dictated by international market demand. Because of shrimp farming’s connectivity with the wider ecosystem, sustainable intensification in shrimp farming will require collective management of water resources at the landscape level for disease and water pollution control. Ecological principles for pond management need to be promoted to farmers in order to reduce farmers’ inefficient practices and build their capacity to understand new techniques and inputs available in the Vietnamese market. Our paper demonstrates for the utility of a multi-level, multi-dimension, and multi-stakeholder aquaculture innovation systems approach to analyze and address these blocking mechanisms in the transition to sustainable intensification in shrimp farming and aquaculture more broadly.},

By 2010, the ISA disease outbreak was under control, but similarly to other countries, Chile continues to occasionally detect the non-pathogenic variant of ISAV (HPR0 ISAV). The Chilean salmon industry has been including gill samples in their routine ISAV monitoring program to improve the detection of HRP0 ISAV, which provides an opportunity to better assess the distribution of HPR0 ISAV and describe its occurrence in the Chilean marine aquaculture industry. A risk and a relative risk surface map were generated for the predominant regions of the Chilean aquaculture industry, and demonstrated areas of increased risk to HPR0 ISAV for the entire surveillance period. The observed occurrence and seasonal patterns of HPR0 ISAV were similar to those previously reported in Chile and in other countries. Further, spatiotemporal cluster analysis showed that the areas with a high-risk of HPR0 ISAV changed during the surveillance period (highly prevalent and causing non-clinical transient infections), and cases in clusters were initially observed within companies, followed by neighboring farms affecting other companies. Monitoring HPR0 ISAV in marine phase salmon production highlighted possible transmission patterns within the Chilean aquaculture industry and identified higher-risk areas associated with circulating orthomyxoviruses.},

I argue that both sustainability and externalities reflect a systems perspective and propose that effective sustainability solutions require that more attention is given to system feedbacks, notably other-regarding preferences and social interactions, and energy and environmental rebound. The case of climate change and policy is used to illustrate particular statements. As a conclusion, a list of 20 insights and suggestions for research is offered.},

However, he continues with the Delphic statement "(Delphic statements were uttered by the renowned oracle of ancient Greece at Delphi. They were phrased in such a way as to be self-fulfilling because alternative interpretations covered every possibility.)" "Without externalities the problem of sustainability vanishes". If this statement refers to an impossible economic process that produces no externalities then he is right. However, it might be interpreted as stating that whenever environmental policy internalizes environmental externalities then sustainability will be ensured. In this note, I assert that in the real world where externalities prevail, their internalization or neutralization in the traditional way cannot lead to sustainability. Only if internalization takes a very specific form that results in the inviolable preservation of environmental rights of future generations in pure biological terms can sustainability be ensured.

	abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y−1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y−1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector and continues to expand alongside terrestrial crop and livestock production. Using portfolio theory as a conceptual framework, we explore how current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change. Aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, aquaculture’s reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminishes its ability to add resilience. Feeds for livestock and farmed fish that are fed rely largely on the same crops, although the fraction destined for aquaculture is presently small (∼4\%). As demand for high-value fed aquaculture products grows, competition for these crops will also rise, as will the demand for wild fish as feed inputs. Many of these crops and forage fish are also consumed directly by humans and provide essential nutrition for low-income households. Their rising use in aquafeeds has the potential to increase price levels and volatility, worsening food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations. Although the diversification of global food production systems that includes aquaculture offers promise for enhanced resilience, such promise will not be realized if government policies fail to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity, and environmental protection.},

It is argued that the core difference between aquaculture and traditional fisheries is the degree of control; control of the environment, production, and marketing systems. It is further argued that the degree of control is closely related to the strength of property rights. Three examples are presented to provide empirical support for the propositions.

	abstract = {Marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for increasing seafood production in the face of growing demand for marine protein and limited scope for expanding wild fishery harvests. However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015\% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives.},

Can we meet society's growing food needs while reducing agriculture's environmental harm? Here, an international team of environmental and agricultural scientists uses new geospatial data and models to identify four strategies that could double food production while reducing environmental impacts. First, halt agricultural expansion. Second, close 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands. Third, increase cropping efficiency. And finally, we need to change our diets and shift crop production away from livestock feed, bioenergy crops and other non-food applications.},

Despite space-time patterns suppose aggregation, specific locations related to different infestation levels, and factors associated crossways the geographic range had not been investigated yet. The understanding effects factors can be considered for integrated pest management (IPM). In the present study, the multivariate spatial scan statistic was used to identify geographic areas and times of C. rogercresseyi infestation and estimate the factors associated with such patterns. We used official C. rogercresseyi monitoring data at the farm level with a set of 13 covariates to provide adjustment within the analyzes. The analyses were carried out across five years (2012-2016) and between three fish species (Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and, O. kisutch) to assess the consistency of the identified clusters. A retrospective multinomial, spatial, and temporal scan test was implemented to identify farms clusters of either different categories of C. rogercresseyi infected farms: baseline, medium, and high based on the control chemical threshold of the health authority. The baseline represents an adequate performance against C. rogercresseyi infection. Then, the production and environmental factors of the medium and high infection were compared with the baseline using regression techniques. The results revealed 26 clusters (p {\textless} 0.001) of which 12 correspond to the baseline, whereas one is a medium, and 13 are high infection clusters were detected. In general, the clusters of the baseline are detected in a latitudinal gradient on estuarine areas, with increasing relative risks to islands system waters complex. There is a spatial structure in specific sites (northern of Los Lagos region and central Aysén region) with high infection clusters and epidemic peaks during 2013. In addition, average weight, salmon species, chemical control ingredient, latitude, temperature, salinity, and year category are factors associated with these patterns. Recommendations for IPM plan are provided along with a discussion considering to involve stock density thresholds by salmon species and the spatial structure of the efficacy of chemical control to avoid the advance of resistance and to minimize environmental residues.},

We explored and contrasted land ownership, forest cover and ecosystem services supply (ES) distribution in two municipalities of southern Chile (Panguipulli and Ancud), comprising 5,584 private properties. We relied on farm typologies data and ES indicators for forage, water regulation, and recreation opportunities. We calculated Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients to establish concentration ratios, and performed a hotspot analysis to determine ES supply distribution across properties. In both municipalities land ownership was highly concentrated: large properties ({\textgreater}1,000–30,000 ha) represented less than 1\% of total and comprised 74.5\% and 20.7\% of farm area, in Panguipulli and Ancud respectively. Forest cover distribution followed the same pattern (80.5\% and 58.2\%, respectively). As a result, water regulation and recreation opportunities concentrated in medium and large properties, whereas forage concentrated in small and medium ones. Gini coefficients ranged from relatively equal to relatively unequal for land ownership, forests cover and ES in both study areas. These inequalities reflect a historical land ownership concentration in private lands since colonial times, a structural condition that challenges both nature conservation and development and, therefore, it should be brought to the forefront of policy design in developing countries.},

Despite considerable progress in identifying factors that affect the prospects for collective action, no consensus exists about the role played by heterogeneity and size of group. The debate continues in part because of a lack of uniform conceptualization of these factors, the existence of non-linear relationships, and the mediating role played by institutions. This article draws on research by scholars in the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research network which demonstrates that some forms of heterogeneity do not negatively affect some forms of collective action. More importantly, IFRI research draws out the interrelations among group size, heterogeneity, and institutions. Institutions can affect the level of heterogeneity or compensate for it. Group size appears to have a non-linear relationship to at least some forms of collective action. Moreover, group size may be as much an indicator of institutional success as a precondition for such success.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. We postulate that the causes of the problem of invasive alien species are primarily economic and, as such, require economic solutions. Invasive alien species are of increasing concern for four reasons. First, introductions are increasing sharply, while mechanisms for excluding or eradicating alien species have been either withdrawn or progressively weakened. Both trends are due to the liberalization of and increase in international travel and trade, an economic phenomenon. Second, the costs of invasions are rising rapidly due partly to increasing human population density, and partly to increasing intensity of production in genetically impoverished agricultural systems. Third, biological invasions are associated with a high degree of uncertainty both because they involve novel interactions, and because invasion risks are endogenous. Actual risks depend on how people react to the possibility of invasions. Fourth, the exclusion and control of invasive species is a "weakest-link" public good. This places the well-being of society in the hands of the least effective provider. We argue that an economic solution to the problem of invasive species has two components. One is to use incentives to change human behavior so as to enhance protection against the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive behavior. The other is to develop institutions that support the weakest members of global society, converting a "weakest-link" to a "best-shot" public good.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to review theoretical and empirical findings in economics with respect to the challenging question of how to manage invasive species. The review revealed a relatively large body of literature on the assessment of damage costs of invasive species; single species and groups of species at different geographical scales. However, the estimated damage costs show large variation, from less than 1 million USD to costs corresponding to 12\% of gross domestic product, depending on the methods employed, geographical scale, and scope with respect to inclusion of different species. Decisions regarding optimal management strategies, when to act in the invasion chain and which policy to choose, have received much less attention in earlier years, but have been subject to increasing research during the last decade. More difficult, but also more relevant policy issues have been raised, which concern the targeting in time and space of strategies under conditions of uncertainty. In particular, the weighting of costs and benefits from early detection and mitigation against the uncertain avoidance of damage with later control, when the precision in targeting species is typically greater is identified as a key challenge. The role of improved monitoring for detecting species and their spread and damage has been emphasized, but questions remain on how to achieve this in practice. This is in contrast to the relatively large body of literature on policies for mitigating dispersal by trade, which is regarded as one of the most important vectors for the spread of invasive species. On the other hand, the literature on how to mitigate established species, by control or adaptation, is much more scant. Studies evaluating causes for success or failure of policies against invasive in practice are in principal non-existing.},

To cover the demand for fish in the growing human population, continued high growth rates in aquaculture are needed. A potential constraint to such growth is infectious diseases, as disease transmission rates are expected to increase with increasing densities of farmed fish. Using an extensive dataset from all farms growing salmonids along the Norwegian coast, we document that densities of farmed salmonids surrounding individual farms have a strong effect on farm levels of parasitic sea lice and efforts to control sea lice infections. Furthermore, increased intervention efforts have been unsuccessful in controlling elevated infection levels in high salmonid density areas in 2009–2010. Our results emphasize host density effects of farmed salmonids on the population dynamics of sea lice and suggest that parasitic sea lice represent a potent negative feedback mechanism that may limit sustainable spatial densities of farmed salmonids.},

	abstract = {Parasitic salmon lice are potentially harmful to salmonid hosts and farm produced lice pose a threat to wild salmonids. To control salmon lice infections in Norwegian salmonid farming, numbers of lice are regularly counted and lice abundance is reported from all salmonid farms every month. We have developed a stochastic space-time model where monthly lice abundance is modelled simultaneously for all farms. The set of farms is regarded as a network where the degree of contact between farms depends on their seaway distance. The expected lice abundance at each farm is modelled as a function of i) lice abundance in previous months at the same farm, ii) at neighbourhood farms, and iii) other, unspecified sources. In addition, the model includes explanatory variables such as seawater temperature and farm-numbers of fish. The model gives insight into factors that affect salmon lice abundance and contributing sources of infection. New findings in this study were that 66\% of the expected salmon lice abundance was attributed to infection within farms, 28\% was attributed to infection from neighbourhood farms and 6\% to non-specified sources of infection. Furthermore, we present the relative risk of infection between neighbourhood farms as a function of seaway distance, which can be viewed as a between farm transmission kernel for salmon lice. The present modelling framework lays the foundation for development of future scenario simulation tools for examining the spread and abundance of salmon lice on farmed salmonids under different control regimes.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, empirical evidence of regional agglomeration economies has emerged for some industries. This paper argues that externalities from agglomeration are not only present in some manufacturing and service sectors, but can also occur in primary industries, such as aquaculture. Econometric analyses in this literature have primarily estimated rather restrictive production function specifications on aggregated industry data. Here, cost functions are estimated on firm-level observations of Norwegian salmon aquaculture farms. This approach provides us with measures of the cost savings due to agglomeration externalities. Furthermore, we avoid aggregation biases and can test a rich set of hypotheses on how these externalities affect the structure of costs at the firm level. According to the econometric estimates, there are significant cost savings associated with localization in regions with a large salmon aquaculture industry, suggesting the presence of positive agglomeration externalities. In fact, the results here suggest that for small firms localized in clusters, agglomeration externalities can compensate for internal economies of scale, making them competitive relative to larger firms localized outside clusters. The econometric results imply that there are significant welfare gains to be made from changes in the government regulation of the industry.},

	abstract = {Norway is at present the largest salmon producer in the world. Norwegian salmon aquaculture has come a long way since its beginning in the late 1960s; from small-scale operations run by one person to today's industry, dominated by international and national companies. Along the way, the industry's impacts have also changed considerably, regarding effects on local and national economies, employment, and not least in terms of environmental impacts and risks. To manage the impacts and risks, salmon aquaculture requires a license from the state. These have been issued in license rounds. With increasing profitability, the competition for licenses has increased. The rounds have been announced with varying objectives or concerns that the authorities want to achieve. The article presents an analysis of the objectives in the licensing rounds announced from 2002 to 2013. The article describes how each round of licenses has incorporated various central concerns, and how political motivations of shifting governments have influenced the requirements. The authors also investigate to what extent conditions for awarded licenses are controlled and monitored by the authorities, and if and how any breaches have been sanctioned. The article concludes by discussing whether the licensing system is a suitable instrument for meeting the objectives that the authorities have for the aquaculture industry in Norway.},

Right from the start, farmers were licensed, with a limit on total production. In addition, each site was regulated according to carrying capacity. Over the years, various management measures have been used to regulate both the total production and environmental conditions, before ending up with Maximum Allowable Biomass (MAB). Since 2005, this has been the common “currency” in all regulations. Since then, the industry has experienced various new management schemes, to cater for environmental sustainability (green licenses, the traffic light system, development licenses, offshore as well as land based production), all based on MAB. The article sets out to explain why and how Norwegian authorities have chosen to regulate total production at national level, and when this failed, why they have maintained MAB as a key regulatory instrument.},

Since 1992, Norwegian salmon production has increased to ten times its 1992 level. By 2015, the Norwegian production constituted 53\% of the world's production of Atlantic salmon. Therefore, it could be said that salmon farming is the most important industry in rural Norway today, with a yearly landing value of about 6.1 billion EUR. As the production has grown, along with the income, numerous environmental issues have arisen. The present paper gives an overview of these environmental problems and discusses potential solutions, as well as the need for a better and more holistic regulation of the industry. The experience from Norwegian salmon farming with respect to environmental issues and regulation may give important insights to both other salmon producing countries as well as producers of other fish species.},

The initial cluster centers are effectively selected from those points which lie on the boundary of higher radius Voronoi circles. As a result, the proposed method automates the selection of the initial cluster centers to supply them for K-means. The proposed method is experimented on various artificial (hand-made) as well as real world data sets of various dimensions.

In Norway, the government has enacted a framework where salmon lice-induced mortality in wild salmonid populations is used for assessing the environmental sustainability in production zones. Direct measurements of the level of lice-induced mortality on wild salmonids are difficult to acquire, thus comprehensive sustainability assessments are based on a set of evidence-based proxies. One such proxy is the infestation pressure from a bio-hydrodynamic model, from which we develop an index that summarize the sustainability of aquaculture in terms of lice infestation. This index is based on the proportion of areas with elevated lice loads, and is a novel approach used to investigate how sustainability could be achieved through scenario testing of different management strategies. The analyses identified a mismatch between legal and sustainable lice levels, but also a beneficial effect of reducing lice levels on farms. This study’s approach demonstrated how bio-hydrodynamic models might be used to assess sustainability and to predict the necessary reduction of lice larvae from farms to classify the entire Norwegian aquaculture industry as environmentally sustainable.},

The green licenses as well as development licenses are described more in detail, while licenses for land-based and offshore production are also included. While the special purpose licenses no doubt have served collective needs in the industry, such as education, research and innovation, they have also acted as backdoor to cheaper licenses. (The ordinary commercial licenses now are traded in the range of USD 15–20 million for a standard license of 780 tons of maximum allowable biomass (MAB)). Their effects on the ordinary license system, where growth is now regulated by the traffic light system, seem to be largely underestimated. In spite of turning the allocation of licenses into a more objective process, there is still a large degree of political and administrative discretion involved. The complete system has over time become very complicated and difficult to control. Attempts of reforming the system have so far largely been unsuccessful.

Sea lice, a common ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids, have been shown to reduce fish growth and appetite and cause substantial costs to salmon farmers worldwide. Our results suggest that the percent of total biomass growth lost per production cycle due to average infestations varies from 3.62 to 16.55\%, despite control, and depends on farm location. Using a discrete harvesting model, we simulate the economic impact on farm profits over typical cycles. An average infestation over a typical central region spring-release cycle generates damages of US\$0.46 per kg of harvested biomass, equivalent to 9\% of farm revenues. We estimate that lice parasitism produced US\$436m in damages to the Norwegian industry in 2011.},

Most of this data is spatially auto-correlated, which violates the classical i.i.d. assumption (identically and independently distributed data) commonly used in machine learning. One of the largest challenges in relation to spatial auto-correlation is how to generate testing sets that are sufficiently independent of the training data. In the geoscience and ecological literature, spatially stratified cross-validation is increasingly used as an alternative to standard random cross-validation. Spatial cross-validation, however, is not yet widely studied in the machine learning setting, and theoretical and empirical support is largely lacking. Our study aims at formally introducing spatial cross-validation to the machine learning community. We present experiments on data sets from two different domains (mammalian ecology and agriculture), which include globally distributed multi-target data, and show how standard cross-validation may lead to over-optimistic evaluation. We propose how to use tailored spatial cross-validation in this context to achieve more realistic assessment of performance and prudent model selection.},

	abstract = {Data-driven machine learning algorithms have initiated a paradigm shift in hedonic house price and rent modeling through their ability to capture highly complex and non-monotonic relationships. Their superior accuracy compared to parametric model alternatives has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature. However, the statistical independence of the data implicitly assumed by resampling-based error estimates is unlikely to hold in a real estate context as price-formation processes in property markets are inherently spatial, which leads to spatial dependence structures in the data. When performing conventional cross-validation techniques for model selection and model assessment, spatial dependence between training and test data may lead to undetected overfitting and overoptimistic perception of predictive power. This study sheds light on the bias in cross-validation errors of tree-based algorithms induced by spatial autocorrelation and proposes a bias-reduced spatial cross-validation strategy. The findings confirm that error estimates from non-spatial resampling methods are overly optimistic, whereas spatially conscious techniques are more dependable and can increase generalizability. As accurate and unbiased error estimates are crucial to automated valuation methods, our results prove helpful for applications including, but not limited to, mass appraisal, credit risk management, portfolio allocation and investment decision making.},

In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

	abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

	abstract = {Aim Processes and variables measured in ecology are almost always spatially autocorrelated, potentially leading to the choice of overly complex models when performing variable selection. One way to solve this problem is to account for residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) for each subset of variables considered and then use a classical model selection criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC). However, this method can be laborious and it raises other concerns such as which spatial model to use or how to compare different spatial models. To improve the accuracy of variable selection in ecology, this study evaluates an alternative method based on a spatial cross-validation procedure. Such a procedure is usually used for model evaluation but can also provide interesting outcomes for variable selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Innovation We propose to use a special case of spatial cross-validation, spatial leave-one-out (SLOO), giving a criterion equivalent to the AIC in the absence of spatial autocorrelation. SLOO only computes non-spatial models and uses a threshold distance (equal to the range of RSA) to keep each point left out spatially independent from the others. We first provide some simulations to evaluate how SLOO performs compared with AIC. We then assess the robustness of SLOO on a large-scale dataset. R software codes are provided for generalized linear models. Main conclusions The AIC was relevant for variable selection in the presence of RSA if the independent variables considered were not spatially autocorrelated. It otherwise failed because highly spatially autocorrelated variables were more often selected than others. Conversely, SLOO had similar performances whether the variables were themselves spatially autocorrelated or not. It was particularly useful when the range of RSA was small, which is a common property of spatial tools. SLOO appears to be a promising solution for selecting relevant variables from most ecological spatial datasets.},

	abstract = {Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data.
The book is divided into three parts: (I) Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R, (II) extensions, which covers advanced techniques, and (III) applications to real-world problems. The chapters cover progressively more advanced topics, with early chapters providing strong foundations on which the later chapters build. Part I describes the nature of spatial datasets in R and methods for manipulating them. It also covers geographic data import/export and transforming coordinate reference systems. Part II represents methods that build on these foundations. It covers advanced map making (including web mapping), "bridges" to GIS, sharing reproducible code, and how to do cross-validation in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Part III applies the knowledge gained to tackle real-world problems, including representing and modeling transport systems, finding optimal locations for stores or services, and ecological modeling. Exercises at the end of each chapter give you the skills needed to tackle a range of geospatial problems.

However, the characteristics of spatial data, especially spatial autocorrelation, are widely ignored. We hypothesize that this is problematic and results in models that can reproduce training data but are unable to make spatial predictions beyond the locations of the training samples. We assume that not only spatial validation strategies but also spatial variable selection is essential for reliable spatial predictions. We introduce two case studies that use remote sensing to predict land cover and the leaf area index for the “Marburg Open Forest”, an open research and education site of Marburg University, Germany. We use the machine learning algorithm Random Forests to train models using non-spatial and spatial cross-validation strategies to understand how spatial variable selection affects the predictions. Our findings confirm that spatial cross-validation is essential in preventing overoptimistic model performance. We further show that highly autocorrelated predictors (such as geolocation variables, e.g. latitude, longitude) can lead to considerable overfitting and result in models that can reproduce the training data but fail in making spatial predictions. The problem becomes apparent in the visual assessment of the spatial predictions that show clear artefacts that can be traced back to a misinterpretation of the spatially autocorrelated predictors by the algorithm. Spatial variable selection could automatically detect and remove such variables that lead to overfitting, resulting in reliable spatial prediction patterns and improved statistical spatial model performance. We conclude that in addition to spatial validation, a spatial variable selection must be considered in spatial prediction models of ecological data to produce reliable results.},

	abstract = {Applications of machine-learning-based approaches in the geosciences have witnessed a substantial increase over the past few years. Here we present an approach that accounts for spatial autocorrelation by introducing spatial features to the models. In particular, we explore two types of spatial features, namely spatial lag and eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF). These features are used within the widely used random forest (RF) method, and their effect is illustrated on two public datasets of varying sizes (Meuse and California housing datasets). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used to determine the best subset of spatial features, and nested cross-validation is used for hyper-parameter tuning and performance evaluation. We utilize Moran’s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) to assess how spatial autocorrelation is captured at both global and local scales. Our results show that RF models combined with either spatial lag or ESF features yield lower errors (up to 33\% different) and reduce the global spatial autocorrelation of the residuals (up to 95\% decrease in Moran’s I) compared to the RF model with no spatial features. The local autocorrelation patterns of the residuals are weakened as well. Compared to benchmark geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, the RF models with spatial features yielded more accurate models with similar levels of global and local autocorrelation in the prediction residuals. This study reveals the effectiveness of spatial features in capturing spatial autocorrelation and provides a generic machine-learning modelling workflow for spatial prediction.},

Geographic information datasets are an example where the data points have stronger dependencies among each other the closer they are geographically. This phenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC) causes the standard cross validation (CV) methods to produce optimistically biased prediction performance estimates for spatial models, which can result in increased costs and accidents in practical applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a modified version of the CV method called spatial k-fold cross validation (SKCV), which provides a useful estimate for model prediction performance without optimistic bias due to SAC. We test SKCV with three real-world cases involving open natural data showing that the estimates produced by the ordinary CV are up to 40\% more optimistic than those of SKCV. Both regression and classification cases are considered in our experiments. In addition, we will show how the SKCV method can be applied as a criterion for selecting data sampling density for new research area.},

	abstract = {Random cross-validation (CV) is often used to evaluate geospatial machine learning models, particularly when a limited amount of sample data are available, and collecting an extra test set is unfeasible. However, the prediction locations can be substantially different from the available sample, leading to over-optimistic evaluation results. This has fostered the development of spatial CV methods. Yet these methods only focus on spatial autocorrelation and cannot sufficiently guarantee that the validation subset is a good proxy of the test set with significant differences. In this paper, we propose the spatial+ cross-validation (SP-CV) method. This method, which considers both the geographic and feature spaces, is composed of two stages. The first stage addresses spatial autocorrelation issues by using agglomerative hierarchical clustering to divide the available sample into blocks. The second stage deals with multiple sources of differences. It uses cluster ensembles to split the blocks into training and validation folds based on the locations of the sample data and the values of the covariates and target variable. The proposed method is compared against random and block CV methods in a series of experiments with Amazon basin above ground biomass and California houseprice datasets. Our results show that SP-CV provided the smallest error differences with respect to the reference error. This means that SP-CV produced more representative splits and led to more reliable model evaluations. It suggests that a reliable model evaluation requires to consider both the geographic and the feature spaces in a comprehensive manner.},

We offer a heuristic derivation of the AIC in this context and provide simulation results that show that using AIC for a geostatistical model is superior to the often-used traditional approach of ignoring spatial correlation in the selection of explanatory variables. These ideas are further demonstrated via a model for lizard abundance. We also apply the principle of minimum description length (MDL) to variable selection for the geostatistical model.

Here we briefly review the model selection approach based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and present a new routine for Spatial Analysis in Macroecology (SAM) software that helps establishing minimum adequate models in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Innovation We illustrate how a model selection approach based on the AIC can be used in geographical data by modelling patterns of mammal species in South America represented in a grid system (n = 383) with 2° of resolution, as a function of five environmental explanatory variables, performing an exhaustive search of minimum adequate models considering three regression methods: non-spatial ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial eigenvector mapping and the autoregressive (lagged-response) model. The models selected by spatial methods included a smaller number of explanatory variables than the one selected by OLS, and minimum adequate models contain different explanatory variables, although model averaging revealed a similar rank of explanatory variables. Main conclusions We stress that the AIC is sensitive to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, generating unstable and overfitted minimum adequate models to describe macroecological data based on non-spatial OLS regression. Alternative regression techniques provided different minimum adequate models and have different uncertainty levels. Despite this, the averaged model based on Akaike weights generates consistent and robust results across different methods and may be the best approach for understanding of macroecological patterns.},

A license is an important tool in ensuring an orderly development of an industry, providing rights as well as obligations. However, the constraints imposed by a license can also prevent desirable activities. In the Norwegian aquaculture industry this has been addressed by creating special purpose license to promote some activities such as education and research, but which are operated in collaboration with commercial farms. While these licenses are not regarded as a part of the industry's regulatory system, the paper shows that that this can be a challenge as 17\% of the current production capacity is in the form of special purpose licenses. This raises the questions of how well the special purpose license achieve their objectives or whether they undermine the regulatory system. This challenge is particularly pertinent in an industry with high profitability and strong barriers to further growth.},

When economic agents are limited to harvesting a renewable resource from a fixed geographical area, dispersion of the resource creates a tragedy of the commons. A dynamic optimization problem is constructed where economic agents control fixed areas. The growth of the resource occurring in each area disperses. It is shown that the desired stock size for maximizing agents in their own area decreases inversely with the amount of leakage—the degree to which the resource is common. The socially optimal stock in each region is a function of the marginal profit for all areas that receive dispersing organisms, and may be greater than the privately optimal stock for an area if that area captured all of its own resource growth. This effect is enhanced if the dispersal rate is stock dependent, possibly creating a ‘double’ tragedy. In a source and sink situation, the socially optimal solution may involve eliminating all harvesting in the source region.},

	abstract = {Regulation of fisheries using spatial property rights can alleviate competition for high-value patches that hinders economic efficiency in quota-based, rights-based, and open-access management programs. However, efficiency gains erode when delineation of spatial rights constitutes incomplete ownership of the resource, thereby degrading its local value and promoting overexploitation. Incomplete ownership may be particularly prevalent in the spatial management of mobile fishery species. We developed a game-theoretic bioeconomic model of spatial property rights representing territorial user rights fisheries (TURF) management of nearshore marine fish and invertebrate species with mobile adult and larval life history stages. Strategic responses by fisheries in neighboring management units result in overexploitation of the stock and reduced yields for each fishery compared with those attainable without resource mobility or with coordination or sole control in fishing effort. High dispersal potential of the larval stage, a common trait among nearshore fishery species, coupled with scaling of management units to only capture adult mobility, a common characteristic of many nearshore TURF programs, in particular substantially reduced stock levels and yields. In a case study of hypothetical TURF programs of nearshore fish and invertebrate species, management units needed to be tens of kilometers in alongshore length to minimize larval export and generate reasonable returns to fisheries. Cooperation and quota regulations represent solutions to the problem that need to be quantified in cost and integrated into the determination of the acceptability of spatial property rights management of fisheries.},

While methods to calculate sources, sinks, and metapopulation persistence exist for discrete-time models, there is no method that is consistent across modeling frameworks. In this paper, we show how next-generation matrices, originally popularized in epidemiology to calculate new infections after one generation, can be used in an ecological context to calculate sources and sinks as well as metapopulation persistence in marine metapopulations. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we construct a next-generation matrix for a network of sea lice populations on salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, BC, an intensive salmon farming region on the west coast of Canada where certain salmon farms are currently being removed under an agreement between local First Nations and the provincial government. The column sums of the next-generation matrix can determine if a habitat patch is a source or a sink and the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix can determine the persistence of the metapopulation. With respect to salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, we identify the salmon farms which are acting as the largest sources of sea lice and show that in this region the most productive sea lice populations are also the most connected. The farms which are the largest sources of sea lice have not yet been removed from the Broughton Archipelago, and warming temperatures could lead to increased sea louse growth. Calculating sources, sinks, and persistence in marine metapopulations using the next-generation matrix is biologically intuitive, mathematically equivalent to previous methods, and consistent across different modeling frameworks.},

	abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

Here, I briefly review four fields of marine biology that each differentially illuminate the scale of marine neighborhoods: effects of marine reserves, tagging studies, microchemistry, and population genetics. These suggest adult neighborhood sizes for many demersal fish and invertebrates as small as kilometers and up to 10 to 100 km. Larval dispersal may be shorter than previously suspected: neighborhood sizes of 10 to 100 km for invertebrates and 50 to 200 km for fish are common in current compilations. How can small reserves protect such species? One conceptual framework is to set reserve size based on adult neighborhood sizes of highly fished species and determine spacing of a reserve network based on larval neighborhoods. The multispecies nature of fisheries demands that network designs accommodate different life histories and take into account the way local human communities use marine resources.},

	abstract = {The appropriate configuration of marine reserves for maximizing harvests or ensuring species persistence when there is uncertainty or variability in larval dispersal patterns is not completely understood. This is particularly true in environments with large alongshore advection rates, as the success of a system of marine reserves depends on connectivity through larval and/or adult dispersal between adjacent marine reserves. In this paper, the consequences of alongshore advection in the presence of marine reserves for a fish species with sedentary adults and widely dispersing larvae are examined. First, a uniform configuration of reserves with constant alongshore advection rate is considered. The highest overall catch and recruitment rates occur when the spacing between reserves is precisely tuned to the advection distance. When the alongshore advection distance is allowed to vary in time, catch and recruitment are considerably less sensitive to alongshore advection. At small diffusion distances, catch values differ from what would be predicted from the time-averaged larval dispersal pattern due to density-dependent post-settlement effects. It is important to include short time scale settlement variability in marine reserve models under these conditions. When the spacing between reserves is allowed to vary, the tuning of the system to particular advection distances is less precise. Configurations of marine reserves with a variety of spacings between reserves exhibited more uniform catch levels as a function of advection distance. This suggests that variability in the spacing between reserves is desirable for protecting a diverse group of species with different dispersal patterns.},

Griliches. 1984. “Econometric Models for Count Data with an Application to the Patents-R \&amp; D Relationship.” Econometrica 52 (4): 909–938.] have defined the Poisson fixed effects (PFE) estimator to estimate models of panel data with count dependent variables under distributional assumptions conditional on covariates and unobserved heterogeneity, but without any restriction on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity conditional on covariates. Wooldridge [Wooldridge, J. M. 1999. “Distribution-Free Estimation of some Nonlinear Panel Data Models.” Journal of Econometrics 90 (1): 77–97.] showed that the PFE estimator is actually consistent even if the distributional assumptions of the PFE model are violated, as long as the restrictions imposed on the conditional mean of the dependent variable are satisfied. In this note I study the efficiency of the PFE estimator in the absence of distributional assumptions. I show that the PFE estimator corresponds to the optimal estimator for random coefficients models of Chamberlain [Chamberlain, G. 1992. “Efficiency Bounds for Semiparametric Regression.” Econometrica 60 (3): 567–596.] in the particular case where the assumptions of equal conditional mean and variance and zero conditional serial correlation are satisfied, regardless of whether the distributional assumptions of the PFE model hold. For instance the dependent variable does not need to be a count variable. This local efficiency result, combined with the simplicity and robustness of the PFE estimator, should provide a useful additional justification for its use to estimate conditional mean models of panel data.},

	abstract = {The paper derives efficiency bounds for conditional moment restrictions with a nonparametric component. The data form a random sample from a distribution F. There is a given function of the data and a parameter. The restriction is that a conditional expectation of this function is zero at some point in the parameter space. The parameter has two parts: a finite-dimensional component θ and a general function h, which is evaluated at a subset of the conditioning variables. An example is a regression function that is additive in parametric and nonparametric components, as arises in sample selection models. If F is assumed to be multinomial with known (finite) support, then the problem becomes parametric, with the values of h at the mass points forming part of the parameter vector. Then an efficiency bound for θ and for linear functionals of h can be obtained from the Fisher information matrix, as in Chamberlain (1987). The bound depends only upon certain conditional moments and not upon the support of the distribution. A general F satisfying the restrictions can be approximated by a multinomial distribution satisfying the restrictions, and so the explicit form of the multinomial bound applies in general. The efficiency bound for θ is extended to a more general model in which different components of h may depend on different known functions of the variables. Although an explicit form for the bound is no longer available, a variational characterization of the bound is provided. The efficiency bound is applied to a random coefficients model for panel data, in which the conditional expectation of the random coefficients given covariates plays the role of the function h. An instrumental-variables estimator is set up within a finite-dimensional, method-of-moments framework. The bound provides guidance on the choice of instrumental variables.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the innovations of additional flexible methods for modeling an individual term in an additive model. It focuses on how we fit additive models. A general and efficient algorithm for fitting a generalized additive model consists of a hierarchy of three modules: scatterplot smoothers, backfitting algorithm, and local-scoring algorithm. These three steps are a rather natural and intuitive generalization of the usual linear model algorithms, and that is how they were originally conceived. The algorithm for fitting a gam is exactly analogous to the algorithm for glms. The chapter presents the S functions for fitting and understanding generalized additive models. In some cases, especially for generalized linear or additive models, adding residuals to a plot is unhelpful because they can distort the scale dramatically. Any interesting features in the functions get lost because of a few large residuals, even though they may carry a very small weight.},

Data coherent forecasting of such counts has to take the integer and non-negative nature of the data into account. Spatial panel data models that meet the criterion of coherency are relatively sparse. This paper proposes a new spatial panel regression framework with fixed effects to overcome these shortcomings. Depending on whether time dynamic effects are included in the model specification, estimation and inference are based either on a pseudo maximum likelihood method or on quasi-differenced generalized methods of moments. The models’ usefulness is demonstrated in a forecasting exercise of monthly crime counts at census tract level from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

We show that high mobility or lower control by others result in lower private control.
